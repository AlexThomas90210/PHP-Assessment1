This is my php project that im sharing from the Introduction To Web Programming for anyone who is interested.

I decided to create a simple PHP Login app that lets the user Create Account,Login , Logout , Delete Account    ,
When the user is logged in he can see everybody who has created their account.

Any questions,advice or comments on the code are more than welcome!

The project was purely based on backend object orientated PHP and did not require any html other than one form , So I did not put much thought in trying to make it look neat for the client side HTML.
